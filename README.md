My approach:
============

* Wrote out the acceptance criteria as user stories (below)
* Thought about the nouns and verbs in the user stories and converted those to classes/ methods
* Feature tested in irb
* TDD unit tests

Refactored after first submission:

* More thorough tests (for different amounts, for not being able to deposit Â£0, etc)
* Extracted the Statement class
* Added feature testing

Refactored again:

* Used dependency injection of Statement class into BankAccount class
* Mocked Statement class in BankAccount unit tests
* Formatted the money deposited/ withdrawn to two decimal places

User Stories
============

As a user  
So that I have money in the bank  
I want to be able to deposit money  

As a User  
so that I can spend my money  
I want to be able to withdraw money  

As a User  
so that I can track my money  
I want to be able to print my bank statement  

As a User  
So that I can track my spending  
I want to know the date I made transactions  


Possible edge cases:
====================

* Can't withdraw money if balance is zero
* Can't withdraw more money than is available

How to run:
===========

* `bundle install`

start IRB:
..........

* `require './lib/bank_account'`
* `require './lib/statement'`
* `account = BankAccount.new`

* `account.deposit(amount)` to add money to balance
* `account.withdraw(amount)` to remove money from balance
* `account.print_statement` for your printed bank statement.
* Then use `withdraw(amount)`/ `deposit(amount)`/ `print_statement` methods

How to run tests:
=================
* `rspec`
* `rubocop`



Requirements
============

You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
Deposits, withdrawal.
Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

Acceptance criteria
===================

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see
```
date       || credit  || debit  || balance
14/01/2012 ||         || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 ||        || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 ||        || 1000.00
```
